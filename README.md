Estimating the value of pi using Monte Carlo Method  
_idea from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method_

# description
Pi can be calculated through the ratio of the quadrant flushed within a square. 
Mathematically, area of quadrant = 0.25*pi*r^2, while the area of the square = r^2 
Hence, pi = 4 * (area of quadrant) / (area of the square) 

Through the generation of random numbers ranged 0 to 1, we can generate points with x and y coordinates distributed between 0 and 1.
